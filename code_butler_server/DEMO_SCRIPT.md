## Voiceover Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15)
"Hi, I'm [Name], and this is Code Butler - a multi-agent AI code review system we built for this hackathon."

### Problem Statement (0:15 - 0:30)
"Code reviews are essential but time-consuming. Developers spend hours manually checking for security issues, performance problems, and missing documentation. We wanted to automate this."

### Solution Overview (0:30 - 0:45)
"Code Butler uses six specialized AI agents that work together to analyze code. Each agent focuses on a specific area: security, performance, documentation, and more."

### Live Demo Start (0:45 - 1:00)
"Let me show you how it works. I'll create a pull request and start a review."

### During Demo (1:00 - 2:00)
"Watch as the agents analyze the code in parallel. The security agent found a hardcoded API key. The performance agent detected inefficient nested loops. The documentation agent is generating docstrings."

### Features (2:00 - 2:30)
"Our system is 50% faster through intelligent caching. We have one-click autofix that creates pull requests with fixes. The system learns from patterns across repositories."

### Closing (2:30 - 3:00)
"Code Butler makes code reviews faster, more accurate, and completely automated. Check out our GitHub repository for the full implementation. Thank you!"

## Backup Demo Plan

If live demo fails:

1. **Pre-recorded Video**
   - Have a 2-minute screen recording ready
   - Show key features without live interaction

2. **Screenshots**
   - Prepare slides with screenshots
   - Walk through features with static images

3. **Architecture Focus**
   - Emphasize technical implementation
   - Show code structure and design decisions

## Timing Checklist

- [ ] Opening slide: 15 seconds
- [ ] Problem statement: 15 seconds
- [ ] Solution overview: 15 seconds
- [ ] Live demo: 60 seconds
- [ ] Features: 30 seconds
- [ ] Closing: 30 seconds
- [ ] **Total: 3 minutes**

## Practice Runs

1. **First Run**: Time each section, note slow parts
2. **Second Run**: Smooth transitions, fix timing
3. **Third Run**: Add emphasis on key points
4. **Fourth Run**: Final polish, natural delivery
5. **Fifth Run**: Record final version

## Key Talking Points

1. **Innovation**: Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents
2. **Technical Execution**: Serverpod 3, Flutter, AI integration
3. **Impact**: 50% faster, automated, learns over time
4. **Completeness**: Full stack, production-ready, well-documented

## Presentation Assets Needed

- [ ] Opening slide (title, team, logo)
- [ ] Architecture diagram
- [ ] Metrics slide (50% faster, etc.)
- [ ] Impact statement slide
- [ ] Closing slide (GitHub link, contact)

## Recording Tips

1. **Speak clearly** - Enunciate, moderate pace
2. **Show enthusiasm** - Sound excited about the project
3. **Pause for emphasis** - Let key points sink in
4. **Smooth transitions** - Practice switching between apps
5. **Error recovery** - If something breaks, keep going
